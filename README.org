My personal-layer based Spacemacs configuration.

I focus on customizing Emacs's display in unique ways and making the most out of
Spacemacs's config framework.

* Install

  Backup and remove your ~.spacemacs~ file and clone to your home directory.

  Icons, fonts, and ligatures require additional steps or you likely will
  experience strange unicode characters all-over.

*** Ligatures

    The ~pretty-fonts~ pkg requires the [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code Symbol]] ([[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/files/412440/FiraCode-Regular-Symbol.zip][download link]]) font
    installed. Any font can be used in-tandem, the link above is an extract of
    just the ligatures.

*** Icons

    In the ~layers/display/packages.el~, I make heavy use of [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons]].
    The easiest way to install it is running ~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts~.
    In that file you can customize which icons to include and change.

*** Server

    If you use Emacs as a daemon, have ~server?~ true in the leading lines of
    ~init.el~. It is nil by default for users other than myself.

*** Personalization

    Style your font in ~dotspacemacs-default-font~ in ~init.el~ as normal.

    Check out and modify theming changes in ~layers/display/config.el~. I have
    ~Zenburn~ and ~Solarized-light~ themes enabled and configured already. Cycle
    themes with ~SPC T n~.
