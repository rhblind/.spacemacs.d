  "Select a member of an alist with multiple keys. Prettified.

TABLE is the alist which should contain entries where the car is a string.
There should be two types of entries.

1. prefix descriptions like (\"a\" \"Description\")
   This indicates that `a' is a prefix key for multi-letter selection, and
   that there are entries following with keys like \"ab\", \"ax\"…

2. Select-able members must have more than two elements, with the first
   being the string of keys that lead to selecting it, and the second a
   short description string of the item.

The command will then make a temporary buffer listing all entries
that can be selected with a single key, and all the single key
prefixes.  When you press the key for a single-letter entry, it is selected.
When you press a prefix key, the commands (and maybe further prefixes)
under this key will be shown and offered for selection.

TITLE will be placed over the selection in the temporary buffer,
PROMPT will be used when prompting for a key.  SPECIALS is an
alist with (\"key\" \"description\") entries.  When one of these
is selected, only the bare key is returned."
