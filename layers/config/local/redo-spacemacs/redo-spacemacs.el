;;; redo-spacemacs.el --- Redoing spacemacs leader bindings safely -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

(require 'dash)
(require 'dash-functional)

(provide 'redo-spacemacs)

;;; Commentary:

;; I aggressively re-bind and un-bind spacemacs defaults.

;; If `redo-bindings' is non-nil:
;; 1. Removes prefixes/bindings contained within `redo-spacemacs-prefixes-list'.
;; 2. Removes bindings in `redo-spacemacs-undo-bindings-alist'.
;; 3. Adds bindings in `redo-spacemacs-new-bindings-alist'.

;; It is highly recommend to look through the above 3 variables before enabling,
;; defined at end of `layers/config/packages.el' in `config/init-redo-spacemacs'.
